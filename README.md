# Hand Gesture Recognition System for Sign Language (HGRSLTV)

A deep learning-powered web application that helps deaf and mute individuals communicate by translating hand gestures into text and speech.

## 🔍 Overview

Many people with speech and hearing disabilities rely on sign language to communicate. Unfortunately, not everyone understands sign language. This project bridges that communication gap using computer vision and deep learning.

The system captures hand gestures using a webcam and converts them into corresponding text and speech using image recognition and audio synthesis.
